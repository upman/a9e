# a9e
Here are a few pervasive abbreviations from recent years.
k8s (Kubernetes), p13n (personalization), i13n (internationalization), o11y (observability), and most ironic of all a11y (accessibility)

The general trend seems to be to not bother typing out words that are any more than 10 letters.
To help us all adapt to this bold new world, here's a chrome extension that replaces all words with 10 or more letters with it's 
a10e (abbreviation) and shows you what the full word on hover. 

Have fun with your training wheels for the impending communication a9e! (apocalypse)
